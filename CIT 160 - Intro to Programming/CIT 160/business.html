<h1>Ebubechi</h1>
<p>Hello everyone! I'm excited to be using my own written html
code to let you guys know about my Writing Site. I write poems 
and short true-life stories. If you can check it out, that'll 
be lovely. I'll attach the link at the end of this short intro.</p>

<p>Some people may ask: "Is this really a business?" Well, for 
me it is. I've always loved writing so why not take it as a
profession? HAHA just kidding! I love writing as a hobby. If you
want to pay me for it, by all means. But seriously though, I plan
on writing and publishing a book someday. Hopefully, you guys 
will patronize me.</p>

<p>I've had a number of sites over the years, to be honest. But 
I've always had to start all over. Starting all over wasn't easy. 
But it was for the best. At least, that's what society made us 
believe. Maybe this was the way it ought to be from the start. 
Although they say starting again also creates the opportunity to 
be better and stronger, it sucked. Again, maybe this is me going 
through a stage that involved a new beginning. Keyword: Maybe. 
Here's me starting my story all over again; welcome to my mind. 
Edited mind..</p>

<p>Here's a link to my site. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ebubechi/home">Read, share, and be blessed!</a></p>
